# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **A simple dynamic Malthusian model** and is about modelling the dynamics and microfoundations of a Malthusian economy,
which is an important macro model used to describe economic stagnation before the growth era. The model thus plays an important role in understanding 
the economic history. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
