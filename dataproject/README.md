# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **A decriptive data analysis of the Danish Regions** and is about collecting and presenting data about the expenses and number of employees over time in the regions. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We apply the **following datasets**:

1. REGR11: The accounsts of the regions (fetched from DST)
2. PRICE8.xlsx: CPI data (DST)
3. Employment data from the regions fetched from (KRL)

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

%pip install git+https://github.com/alemartinello/dstapi which is a DST API wrapper.
